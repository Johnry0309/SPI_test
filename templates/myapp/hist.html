    <p class="history-content">
        <strong>Skill Power Institute (SPI)</strong> is a non-stock, non-profit learning organization 
        committed to community service through quality education. It was established on 
        <strong>November 4, 1997</strong> and has become one of the pioneers in tertiary computer education, 
        not only in Antipolo but also in neighboring towns and municipalities.
    </p>
    <p class="history-content">
        Following its success in Antipolo, SPI expanded its reach by establishing various branches. 
        <strong>Nego-Skwela</strong> was opened in <strong>Quezon City</strong>, and AMS and CDC courses were introduced in 
        locations such as <strong>Quezon City, Angeles, Cabanatuan, Urdaneta, Tarlac, and Sucat</strong>. 
        These expansions further solidified SPIâ€™s commitment to providing quality education across the country.
